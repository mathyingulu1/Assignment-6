                	<p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.
                         She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.
                          Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African and Irish descent.
                          Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.
                          She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. 
                          Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to physically abuse her mother, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.</p>

                	<p>In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates.
                         She was discovered in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers.
                          Without a name or any material, the girl group managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, "The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.
                           Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's "Emotion" and Mariah Carey's "Hero".
                          Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels</p>

                        While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. 
                        Speaking of the experience she stated, "I've never had vocal training, so when I'm in the studio, he'll tell me how to breathe and stuff... He'll call out these big fancy words: 'OK, I want you to do staccato.' And I'm like, 'OK, I don't know what that is.
                         Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics.
                          James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that "it is Rihanna's vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself</p>
